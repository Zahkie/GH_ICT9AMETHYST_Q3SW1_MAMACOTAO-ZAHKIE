	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xl-2 text-dark bg-warning">Peter Griffin</div>
		<div class="col-xl-10 text-dark bg-warning">Peter Griffin is the central character of "Family Guy." He and his family live in Quahog, Rhode Island. Speaking with a thick New England accent, he operates as if he is smarter than everyone else, but in reality, he's clueless.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xl-2 text-dark bg-warning">Lois Griffin</div>
		<div class="col-xl-10 text-dark bg-warning">Lois Griffin is Peter's wife. She comes from the wealthy Pewterschmidt family and married Peter against their wishes. Lois is an accomplished piano player and singer.She may be more sophisticated than Peter, but we have seen occasionally that she shares his low-brow humor and lustfulness.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xl-2 text-dark bg-warning">Stewie Griffin</div>
		<div class="col-xl-10 text-dark bg-warning">Stewie Griffin may be a baby, but he is as diabolical as the worst villain. He is highly intelligent, but he's still very attached to his teddy bear, Rupert. He has schemed many times to destroy Lois but has failed at every attempt.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xl-2 text-dark bg-warning">Brian Griffin</div>
		<div class="col-xl-10 text-dark bg-warning">Brian is the Griffin family's dog. He seems to be the wisest and most sensible of all the characters, regardless of the fact that he still urinates on the carpet in Lois' presence. Yes, that's right, he is in love with Lois. He and Stewie are usually pitted against each other or drawn together by extreme circumstances, such as a road trip to find Brian's mother or recruitment into the military. </div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xl-2 text-dark bg-warning">Meg Griffin</div>
		<div class="col-xl-10 text-dark bg-warning"> Meg Griffin is the only daughter of Peter and Lois. She is frequently the butt of the family's jokes and is considered to be unattractive and a loser. She and Peter did bond when his driver's license was revoked and she chauffeured him around town. Her chance to shine as a star came in "Don't Make Me Over." Also, she has a crush on Luke Perry.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xl-2 text-dark bg-warning">Chris Griffin</div>
		<div class="col-xl-10 text-dark bg-warning"> Chris Griffin is Peter and Lois' eldest son. He's not terribly bright, but he is a talented artist ("The Son Also Draws") and rock singer ("Saving Private Brian"). He admires his father and follows blindly into many of Peter's misadventures. Also, he fears the crazy monkey in his closet.</div>
